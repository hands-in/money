This a money library which enables you to safely add/multiple/divide/subtract monetary values from each other. There are also local and global money adapters which enable you to compare monetaryvlaues of the same and different currencies. We have not provided an exchange rate service with this library to leave it open for interoperability with multiple exchange services.

This library is created and used by the geniuses at Hands In.
